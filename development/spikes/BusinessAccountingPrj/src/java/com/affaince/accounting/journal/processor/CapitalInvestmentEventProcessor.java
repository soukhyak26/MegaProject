//SourceDocument assumes that any transaction either brings money to the business or sends money by the business to some external stakeholder.
//So it should either have a giver or the receiver as the business. It is system's responsibility to identify the representative business account.
// representative business account can be cash, bank account, discount, profit/loss account, reward etc.
// For each type of event the possible BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES should be provided by the respective Event Processor.
//When one of the party is BUSINESS, the opposite Party will be an external stakeholder.
//Stakeholders are identified as supplier,subscriber,service provider etc.
//The party except business should have the identifier of the stakeholder.
